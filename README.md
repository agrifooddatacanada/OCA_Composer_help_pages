These are the help pages written in HTML associated with OCA Composer. OCA Composer is an open-source product developed by Agri-food Data Canada to help researchers write machine-actionable data schemas using the Overlays Capture Architecture format.

Help pages are specific to each language and organized in the language specific folder (e.g. 'en').

Images used in the help pages are located in the 'images' folder and then within the specific language folder (e.g. 'en').

These help pages appear when users select "Help with this page" while writing a schema using OCA Composer.
