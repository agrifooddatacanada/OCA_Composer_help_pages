    2025.02.05 - Update to OCA Package
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>OCA schemas are released as '[OCA Package](https://github.com/agrifooddatacanada/OCA_package_standard)' and in a single .json file instead of the previous .zip format</li>
    <li>OCA Package consists of two parts: the core OCA syntax as bundle, and extensions which contains custom overlays such as the ordering overlay</li>
    <li>Support for ordering of attributes and entry codes means that things are not sorted by default alphabetically.</li>
    <li>The Schema bundle (a component of package) follows the 1.0.2 release of the OCA Specification. Major changes of this include:
    <ul>
      <li>Type of all overlays increments to version 1.0.2</li>
      <li>Array Datatypes syntax has changed, from array[Numeric] to [Numeric] (etc.)</li>
      <li>Label of the digest changes from "digest:" to "d:"</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
