  <ul>
    <li>OCA schemas are now available as <a href="https://github.com/agrifooddatacanada/OCA_package_standard">OCA Package</a> in the format of a single .json file instead of the previous .zip file</li>
    <li>OCA Package consists of two parts: the core OCA syntax as a Schema Bundle, and Extensions which contains custom overlays such as the ordering overlay</li>
