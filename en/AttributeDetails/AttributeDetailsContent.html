  <p>On the attribute details page, you can edit properties of each attribute present in your schema.</p>
  
  <h3>Attribute Name</h3>
  
  <p>You can edit each attribute name and reorder the attributes.</p>
  
  <h3>Sensitive</h3>
  
  <p>
    Sensitive attributes are where you can specify Sensitive Attribute for sensitive data (e.g., names of people, government identification, birth date, etc.). Marking an entry with a check will allow you to flag any attributes where identifying information about entities may be captured.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Flagging an attribute acts as an alert to data users to treat the data as high-risk throughout the data lifecycle and encrypted or removed at any stage.</li>
    <li>For help evaluating which attributes can be sensitive, you can read advice in the <a style="color: #94002a;" href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/Blinding-Identity-Taxonomy-Report-Version-1.0.html">Blinding Identity Taxonomy</a> report by the Kantara Initiative.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Unit</h3>
  
  <p>Units are where you can describe the units for each attribute if needed.</p>
  
  <h3>Type</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Text: text, from single-letter entries to fields of unstructured text</li>
    <li>Numeric: numbers</li>
    <li>Boolean: a data type where the data only has two possible variables: true or false</li>
    <li>Binary: a data type that defines a binary code signal</li>
    <li>DateTime: a data type that defines dates. Common formats include dates (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD), times (e.g., hh:mm:ss), dates and times concatenated (e.g., YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss+zz:zz), and durations (e.g., PnYnMnD)</li>
    <li>Array [attribute type]: a data type that defines a structure that holds several data items or elements of the same data type</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>List</h3>
  
  <p>
    A list is a very useful feature that allows the schema author to limit the data that can be entered for a specific attribute. Select this option if you would like to create a list of acceptable entries that the user will be able to select from.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the user is able to select only one valid entry from the list (e.g., a list where the user will select the sample location), your data Type will be something suitable like "Text" or "Numeric". If you will allow multi-selection from the list (e.g., a list where the user can select all that apply), then your data Type is an Array.
