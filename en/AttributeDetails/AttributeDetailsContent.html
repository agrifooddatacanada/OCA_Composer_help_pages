  <p>On the attribute details page, you can edit properties of each attribute present in your schema.</p>
  
  <h3>Attribute Name</h3>
  
  <p>You can edit each attribute name and reorder the attributes.</p>
	<p><b>Requirements</b>: Attribute names MUST contain only the following characters: numbers: 0-9, letters: a-z and A-Z, underline: _ hyphen: - period:.</p>
<p><b>Recommendations:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Set Maximum length to 32 characters</li>
    <li>Always start variable names with a letter</li>
    <li>Numbers can be used anywhere in the variable name AFTER the first character</li>
    <li>Do not use blanks or spaces</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>
    Attribute names are recognized by different programs (machine readable) and so a good attribute name is one that won't cause problems downstream.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Sensitive</h3>
  
  <p>
    Sensitive attributes are where you can specify Sensitive Attribute for sensitive data (e.g., names of people, government identification, birth date, etc.). Marking an entry with a check will allow you to flag any attributes where identifying information about entities may be captured.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Flagging an attribute acts as an alert to data users to treat the data as high-risk throughout the data lifecycle and encrypted or removed at any stage.</li>
    <li>For help evaluating which attributes can be sensitive, you can read advice in the <a style="color: #94002a;" href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/Blinding-Identity-Taxonomy-Report-Version-1.0.html" target="_blank">Blinding Identity Taxonomy</a> report by the Kantara Initiative.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Unit</h3>
  
  <p>Units are where you can describe the units for each attribute if needed.</p>
  
  <h3>Type</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Text: text, from single-letter entries to fields of unstructured text. Numbers are text if you can't perform mathmatical operations on them, e.g. a phone number is text.</li>
    <li>Numeric: numbers. If you can't put it into a 'calculator' and directly perform mathematical operations on it, then you have text. For example, the range "1056-1067" is text, the value a10 is text because it has a letter in the name etc.</li>
    <li>Boolean: a data type where the data only has two possible variables: true or false</li>
    <li>BinaryFile: a data type that defines a binary code signal (a binary file)</li>
    <li>DateTime: a data type that defines dates. Common formats include dates (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD), times (e.g., hh:mm:ss), dates and times concatenated (e.g., YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss+zz:zz), and durations (e.g., PnYnMnD)</li>
    <li>Array [attribute type]: a data type that defines a structure that holds several data items or elements of the same data type</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
	Here is an example of a several datatypes.

  <h3>List</h3>
  
  <p>
	To understand lists (aka entry codes) better you can find a worked example on our <a href="https://agrifooddatacanada.ca/examples-of-entry-codes/" target="_blank">blog post about entry codes</a>.
  <p>
    A list is a very useful feature that allows the schema author to limit the data that can be entered for a specific attribute. For example, if your variable has categories you would want to specify your categorites in a list. Select a list if you would like to create a list of acceptable entries that the user will be able to select from.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the user is able to select only one valid entry from the list (e.g., a list where the user will select the sample location), your data type will be something suitable like "Text" or "Numeric". If you will allow multi-selection from the list (e.g., a list where the user can select all that apply), then your data type is an array.
