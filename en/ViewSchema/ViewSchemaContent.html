  <p>
    This is a summary of the schema you have been creating. You can tab through multiple languages (if you have more than one) to see all the schema information for each language.
  </p>
  <p>
    To edit any of the entries use the back button to go back through the schema writer and make your necessary changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you Finish and Export your schema you will create two files. The first will be the machine-readable version of your schema. The second will be the human-readable .txt version of your schema. We suggest you keep these two files together so that both machines and humans can understand your schema.
