  <p>For co-authoring a schema you will have established a base for your schema (the set list of attributes and their associated datatypes). Then you may have different collaborators who have expertise editing the schema and adding features using their expertise.</p>
  <p>For example, you may have someone handle the French translations, while another person writes the descriptions and specifies the units.</p>
  <p>After schema co-authors have worked on their features for the schema it is necessary to recombine the work into a single schema. This is what the Schema Merge tool enables. Where the features (overlays) are the same in each version only the centre checkbox is available to be selected. If the features are different, you can click on the feature to view a comparison. The middle selection is disabled when the features are different and you can select one or the other (or neither).</p>
  <p>When you are finished combining the two schemas you select Finish and Exporto to download a schema that contains all the information you selected.</p>
