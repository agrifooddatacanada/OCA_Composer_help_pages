  <br>
  <p>The Form Information overlay allows you to specify how each attribute and its corresponding answer field appear in a questionnaire or form interface.</p>
  
  <h3>Label</h3>
  <p>The Label field allows you to provide a user-friendly, language-specific label for each attribute. This is what users will see in forms and questionnaires instead of the technical attribute name. Labels should be clear, descriptive, and appropriate for the target audience.</p>
  <p>Labels are where your questionnaire question text will go. This can include full sentences that provide clear instructions to users. For example, a label might read: "On a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate your experience?" or "Please describe your main concerns about this product."</p>
  <p>Labels have a maximum length of 100 characters and can be customized for each language in your schema.</p>
  
  <h3>Placeholder</h3>
  <p>The Placeholder field provides example text or instructions that appear inside form input fields to guide users on what type of information to enter. Placeholders are particularly useful for Text and Array[Text] attribute types where users need to enter free-form text.</p>
  <p>Placeholders are only available for Text and Array[Text] attribute types, as these are the only types that accept free text input from users. For other attribute types (like Numeric, Boolean, etc.), the placeholder field is not editable.</p>
  <p>Placeholders should provide clear, helpful guidance to users about the expected format or content for the field.</p>
  
  <h3>Format Rules Integration</h3>
  <p>The Form Information overlay displays the format rules that have been defined for each attribute. These format rules help ensure data consistency and provide validation for user input. The format rules are read-only in this interface and must be configured in the Format Rules overlay.</p>
  
  <h3>Multi-language Support</h3>
  <p>Form Information supports multiple languages, allowing you to create language-specific labels and placeholders for your attributes. This is particularly useful for international schemas or when working with multilingual datasets.</p>
  
  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
  <p>Before using the Form Information overlay, you must first add Format Rules for your attributes. The Form Information overlay requires format rules to be defined.</p>
