<h3>Why Standardized Units Matter</h3>
<p>
  Units can be written in many different ways. For instance, the concentration unit "micromolar" might appear as <code>uM</code>, <code>μM</code>, <code>umol/L</code>, <code>μmol/l</code>, or <code>umol<sup>-1</sup></code>. This variation can cause confusion or errors in data interpretation.
</p>
<p>
  To ensure clarity, consistency, and interoperability across datasets and systems, it's important to use standardized unit formats. Standards help eliminate ambiguity, especially in collaborative or automated environments.
</p>
<p>
  One widely adopted system for defining and encoding units is the <strong>Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM)</strong>. UCUM provides an unambiguous, machine-readable format for specifying units, supporting accurate data exchange and interpretation.
</p>
<p>The Semantic Engine supports UCUM units through a unit framing overlay. What this means is that you can write the units as you are familiar with them in the unit overlay, and then map your chosen unit (e.g. <code>acre</code>) to the official UCUM terminology (e.g. <code>[acr_us]</code>) in the unit framing overlay.</p>
