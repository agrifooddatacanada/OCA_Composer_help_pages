  <br>
  <p>If you already have a dataset in an Excel or .csv file, you can drag and drop this file onto the main page box. You will not be uploading any dataset. Instead, this website will read the file and extract headers (it assumes they are the first row). These headers become automatically added as attributes to the schema you are creating.</p>
  <p>When using the Semantic Engine, you are downloading the engine to run locally inside your browser. When you add a dataset, it remains on your computer and is used on your machine by the engine code you downloaded. <b>You never upload your dataset to our servers when using the Semantic Engine and we never store your dataset</b>. At the end when you generate the OCA Schema the schema you have written is uploaded to our parser and converted into OCA which you can download.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, you may create your schema manually, where you will write in each attribute name through the user interface.</p>
