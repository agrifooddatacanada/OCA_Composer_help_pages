  <h3>Schema Classification</h3>
  <p>
    The Semantic Engine supports the findability and categorization of schemas through the addition of schema classifications using the controlled vocabulary of Statistics Canada, specifically the <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1278187" target="_blank">Canadian Research and Development Classification (CRDC) 2020 Version 1.0 â€“ Field of Research (FOR)</a>. When you enter your schema classification you are using one of the terms from this controlled list.</p>

  <h3>Schema Description</h3>
  <p>
    The OCA language for writing schemas lets users easily add multiple language support to their schemas. By default the schema begins in English language where you can add a schema title and description. The title and description should help anyone find and use your schema to help them understand how to interpret an associated dataset.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Adding a language</h3>
  <p>
    Languages are referenced in the OCA schema by their <a style="color: #94002a;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes" target="_blank">2 letter ISO language code</a>. You can add multiple languages to your schema by selecting the languages you want to support here. If you would like to see a language added here you can contact us at <a href="mailto:adc@uoguelph.ca">adc@uoguelph.ca</a> with the request.
